      <p>Radio check. Pilot, please confirm.</p>
      <p>This is Pilot. Back over to you, Mission Control.</p>
      <p>Ground Control to Major Tom
         Take your protein pills 
         and put your helmet on</p>
      <p>Well, though I'm past one hundred thousand miles,
         I feel very still.
         My spaceship pretty much knows which way to go.
         Tell my wife I love her very much.
         She knows.</p>
         <p>Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
            Can you hear me, Major Tom?</p>
